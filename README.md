# Apple Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify apples as either good or bad using machine learning techniques. 
The primary focus is on understanding and applying logistic regression, recall, precision, and other related concepts.
Although the initial model uses logistic regression, a brief exploration of decision tree classifiers is also included for comparison.
The project emphasizes learning and experimentation over achieving the highest possible accuracy with the most advanced model.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Setup
To set up your environment to run this notebook, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter using pip

## Notebook Contents

1. **Introduction and Problem Statement**: Overview of the project goals and objectives.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Instructions on loading the dataset and preparing it for the machine learning model.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical analysis to understand the data better.
4. **Model Training**: Steps to train a logistic regression model to classify apples.
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics used to evaluate the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
6. **Adjusting the Model**: Experimentation with different thresholds for the logistic regression model to improve performance.
7. **Results and Conclusion**: Summary of the model's performance and insights gained from the project.
8. **Decision Tree Example**: A brief example of using a decision tree classifier without extensive tweaking for comparison purposes.

## Conclusion
This project serves as an educational exploration of logistic regression and model evaluation metrics. 
While the initial model's performance could be improved, the primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning principles and practices.
